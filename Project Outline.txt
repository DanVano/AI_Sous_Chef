Process Example: Step-by-Step

    User Speaks (“I have chicken, broccoli, and rice”)

        recorder.py → Save audio.

        whisper_stt.py → Transcribe to “I have chicken, broccoli, and rice.”

        intent_parser.py → Detect as ingredients input.

        chatgpt_api.py → Ask ChatGPT for recipe suggestions using those ingredients.

        Recipes shown/read aloud.

    User Picks Recipe

        Recipe is loaded and split into steps via recipe_manager.py.

        Steps stored in session_storage.py.

    Cooking Session Begins

        User says “next step.”

        intent_parser.py recognizes and updates session_storage.py's current step.

        tts.py reads out the next step.

    Session Ends

        Final recipe + user feedback/preferences → persistent_storage.py and user_data.py.

        Temp session files deleted.
